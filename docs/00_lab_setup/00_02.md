1. In the **Azure Portal**, navigate to the **Resource Group** that you created for this lab, then select the **On-premises Workload VM** named similar to `terrafirm-onprem-workload-vm`.

    ![The Resource group with on-premises workload VM highlighted.](../../resources/images/lab00_02_VirtualMachine.png "Azure resource group")

2. On the **Virtual Machine** blade, locate and copy the **Public IP Address** for the VM.

3. Open a new browser window, then navigate to the following `http://` URL to access the simulated on-premises web application provisioned for this lab. Be sure to replace the `<ip-address>` placeholder with the **Public IP Address** for the VM.

    ```text
    http://<ip-address>
    ```

    > **Note**: If you get an error loading the web application, instead of a login page, then there was an error in provisioning. The easiest workaround is to delete the resource group and run the template deployment again.

4. When the web application loads, you may enter the following credentials to login.

    - **Username**: `Admin`
    - **Password**: `ipamadmin`

    ![The login page for the web application is displayed.](../../resources/images/lab00_02_WebApplication.png "Web application login page")

    > **Note**: The first time you login to the web application, it will prompt you to change the Admin password. A recommended password to change it to is `demo!pass123` so it's easily remembered for the lab.

At this point, things are ready for you to go through the lab.
