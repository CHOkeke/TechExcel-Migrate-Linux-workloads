2. On the **New migration project** blade, select the following values:

    - **Project name**: `phpipam`
    - **Source server type**: `MySQL`
    - **Target server type**: `Azure Database for MySQL (Single or Flexible)`
    - **Migration activity type**: `Offline data migration`

3. Select **Create and run activity**.

4. On the **MySQL to Azure Database for MySQL Offline Data Migration Wizard** blade, enter the following values on the **Select source** tab, then select **Next: Select target >>**.

    - **Source server name**: Enter the **Public IP Address** of the on-premises workload server named similar to `terrafirm-onprem-workload-vm`.
    - **Server port**: `3306`
    - **User name**: `root`
    - **Password**: `demopass123`
    - **Encrypt connection**: Uncheck this box.

    ![Offline Data Migration Wizard select source tab with values entered.](../../resources/images/lab01_03_MigrationDatabaseNEW.png "Select source tab")

5. On the **Select target** tab, enter the following values to select the **Azure Database for MySQL** service that was previously provisioned.

    - **Location**: The Azure Region that's used for this lab.
    - **Resource group**: The Resource Group for this lab, named similar to `terrafirm-rg`.
    - **Azure Database for MySQL**: The Azure Database for MySQL service provisioned previously that is named similar to `terrafirm-mysql-db`.
    - **User name**: `mysqladmin`
    - **Password**: `demo!pass123`

    > **Note**: If a different **User name** and **Password** were configured when provisioning the **Azure Database for MySQL** service, then use those credentials instead.

   - **Potential Error**

    ![Offline Data Migration Wizard error.](../../resources/images/lab01_03_MigrationDatabaseERROR.png "User Permission Error")

    > **Note**: This error indicates incorrect MySQL user permissions. During the "Before the HOL" process, in Task 2, Step 4, were you able to successfully log in to the phpipam web application? If not, there might have been an error in the ARM Template deployment scripts. Check the deployment log of the Resource Group for indications of a failed deployment. If the deployment script did fail, you'll need to delete the resources or the entire resource group and then redo the "Before the HOL" deployment steps. Fixing a failed "Before the HOL" deployment isn't straightforward, so recreating it is often the simplest solution.


6. On the **Select database** tab, ensure the `phpipam` database is selected for both the **Source Database** and **Target Database**, then select **Next: Select tables >>**.

    ![The phpipam source and target database are selected with Next: Select tables highlighted.](../../resources/images/lab01_03_MigrationDatabaseSelectDatabases.png "phpipam source and target database")

7. On the **Select tables** tab, expand the `phpipam` table, and make sure all tables are selected, then select **Review and start migration**.

    ![All tables selected with Review and start migration highlighted.](../../resources/images/lab01_03_MigrationDatabaseSelectTables.png "All tables selected")

8. On the **Summary** tab, enter `phpipam` into the **Activity name** field, then select **Start migration**.

    ![Summary tab with Activity name populated and Start migration highlighted.](../../resources/images/lab01_03_MigrationDatabaseSummary.png "Summary tab")

9. A migration details pane will now display, showing the **Status** as **Pending** while the migration is running.

    ![Migration pending status is highlighted.](../../resources/images/lab01_03_MigrationDatabaseStatus.png "Migration pending")

10. After a minute, select **Refresh** to check if the migration has been completed. Once complete, the **Status** will show as **Completed** and the **Migration details** will display the total number of tables that have been migrated.
