# TechExcel: Migrate Linux workloads to Azure

Terra Firm Laboratories is a global bioengineering company that’s the leading researcher and innovator in genetic and biological science technology. The company was founded in 1975 with its corporate headquarters in Palo Alto, CA. Their mission-critical workloads are currently hosted in an on-premises datacenter and are beginning a journey to modernize and migrate into the cloud using Microsoft Azure.
 
The CTO, Dennis Nedry, has kicked off an initiative for the organization to begin adopting the Microsoft Azure cloud and modernize its infrastructure. He has already had his team begin assessing their current environment and what it will take to migrate to the cloud. They are looking to optimize their technology investments by reducing technical debt and streamlining operations using Azure Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) cloud services.
 
Terra Firm Laboratories has already completed the first round of analysis to identify the applications and workloads to begin migrating first. Out of over 250 workloads they have running on-premises, they have identified one workload that exemplifies multiple components common across many of their other workloads. They decided to use a simpler workload that will still assist in proving out the migration plan as it’s developed. This workload includes Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) servers, SUSE, Ubuntu and a custom distro based on Debian.  They currently use FreeIPA for their identity management and want to migrate to a Microsoft solution.

In this lab, attendees will perform steps toward migrating Terra Firm Laboratories on-premises Linux workloads to Microsoft Azure.
